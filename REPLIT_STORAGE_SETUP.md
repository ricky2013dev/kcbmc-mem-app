# Replit Object Storage Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up persistent file uploads for your KCMBC app using Replit's built-in Object Storage.

## üìã Prerequisites

- Your KCMBC app deployed on Replit
- Access to your Replit project settings

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Object Storage Bucket in Replit

1. Open your Replit project
2. Click on **Tools** in the left sidebar
3. Click on **Object Storage**
4. Click **Create Bucket**
5. Name your bucket (e.g., `kcmbc-storage`)
6. Click **Create**

> **Note**: Remember the exact bucket name - you'll need it for Step 2.

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

1. In your Replit project, click on **Secrets** (üîí icon in left sidebar)
2. Add the following environment variables:

```bash
# Replit Object Storage Configuration
PRIVATE_OBJECT_DIR=/your-bucket-name
PUBLIC_OBJECT_SEARCH_PATHS=/your-bucket-name/public

# Environment Configuration
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000

# Session Secret (generate a secure random string)
SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-session-secret-here

# Database URL (use your existing database connection string)
DATABASE_URL=your-existing-database-url
```

**Important**: Replace `your-bucket-name` with the exact name of the bucket you created in Step 1.

#### Example Configuration:
If your bucket is named `kcmbc-storage`, your secrets should look like:

```bash
PRIVATE_OBJECT_DIR=/kcmbc-storage
PUBLIC_OBJECT_SEARCH_PATHS=/kcmbc-storage/public
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000
SESSION_SECRET=abc123xyz789secure-random-string
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/database
```

### Step 3: Restart Your Application

1. Click the **Stop** button in your Replit console
2. Click **Run** to restart with the new configuration
3. Wait for the application to fully start

### Step 4: Test Upload Functionality

1. Open your KCMBC app in the browser
2. Log in with your credentials
3. Navigate to **Family Management**
4. Try uploading a family photo
5. Check the Replit console for success messages

## ‚úÖ Verification

### Console Messages to Look For:

When uploads are working correctly, you should see messages like:

```
Upload request received: {
  useCloudStorage: true,
  hasGoogleCloudConfig: false,
  nodeEnv: 'production'
}
Using object storage for file upload
Successfully uploaded to object storage
Generated object path: /objects/uploads/abc123-1234567890.jpg
```

### File Persistence Test:

1. Upload an image to a family profile
2. Restart your Replit app
3. Check if the image is still accessible
4. ‚úÖ If yes, object storage is working correctly!

## üîß How It Works

### Development vs Production Modes:

| Environment | Storage Type | File Location | Persistence |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Development** (local) | Local disk | `/uploads/` folder | ‚ùå Lost on restart |
| **Production** (Replit) | Object Storage | Replit cloud bucket | ‚úÖ Persistent |

### Automatic Detection:

The application automatically detects which storage to use based on:
- Presence of `PRIVATE_OBJECT_DIR` and `PUBLIC_OBJECT_SEARCH_PATHS` environment variables
- `NODE_ENV=production` setting

### File URL Patterns:

- **Local development**: `http://localhost:3000/uploads/filename.jpg`
- **Replit production**: `https://your-app.replit.app/objects/uploads/filename.jpg`

## üõ† Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### 1. "Object storage temporarily disabled" error
**Cause**: Environment variables not set correctly
**Solution**: Double-check bucket name and environment variables

#### 2. Files not persisting after restart
**Cause**: Still using local storage instead of object storage
**Solution**: Verify `NODE_ENV=production` and restart app

#### 3. Upload fails with 500 error
**Cause**: Bucket doesn't exist or wrong permissions
**Solution**: Recreate bucket and check bucket name in environment variables

### Debug Steps:

1. Check Replit console logs for error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure bucket name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
4. Try restarting the application
5. Test with a small image file first

## üìù Environment Variables Reference

| Variable | Required | Example | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PRIVATE_OBJECT_DIR` | ‚úÖ Yes | `/kcmbc-storage` | Your bucket path for private files |
| `PUBLIC_OBJECT_SEARCH_PATHS` | ‚úÖ Yes | `/kcmbc-storage/public` | Search paths for public files |
| `NODE_ENV` | ‚úÖ Yes | `production` | Enables object storage mode |
| `PORT` | ‚úÖ Yes | `5000` | Replit requires this port |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | ‚úÖ Yes | `your-secret-key` | Session encryption key |
| `DATABASE_URL` | ‚úÖ Yes | `postgresql://...` | Database connection string |

## üéâ Success!

Once configured correctly, your KCMBC app will have:
- ‚úÖ Persistent file uploads that survive app restarts
- ‚úÖ Automatic cloud storage in production
- ‚úÖ Local development support
- ‚úÖ Seamless file serving and management

Your family photos and uploaded files will now be safely stored in Replit's Object Storage and remain accessible even after deployments and updates!

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Review Replit console logs for specific error messages
3. Verify your bucket exists in Tools ‚Üí Object Storage
4. Ensure all environment variables are correctly set
